Hi there 👋

- 🔭 I’m currently working on personal projects to showcase on my GitHub. Projects are fairly simple for now because I am focused on learning basic concepts thoroughly.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning a lot of stuff, a bit like Alice in Wonderland, tumbling down a rabbit hole 🐰
- 👨‍🎓 I am a Software Engineering Student at WeThinkCode_, and I am very passionate about learning and developing in the field.
